//class and objects
/*what is a class?   abstract representation of entity (logic- student academic details : physical- laptop, room etc.)
encapsulation is like a capsule that stores data and code both together and classjust show the abstract view of both the things i.e,
instantanted an object is created.*/


// Creating a class 
/* to declare a class we use the keyword "class" wiht curly braces and ends with a semicolon*/

/*	class NameOfClass{
				datamember;- fields of an entity (student is class and its field is name class address etc.)
				member functtion-  (syntax)  returntype_nameOffUNCTION();

	};
*/
/*	class student{
		int roll;
		char name[20];
		long int phone;
		float cgpa;
		(the above are data members of the class)
		
		void gatData();
		void PrintData;
		(the above is data members)
	};
	
the above is called abstraction.


HOW TO CREATE AN OBJECT 
SYNTAX:		nameOfClass_nameOfObject;

int main() {
student SS; //SS is an object here of class student not a variable.
}

the above is called encapsulation.
the data part of the capsule will store the data member info
the code part of the capsule will store the member functions.
